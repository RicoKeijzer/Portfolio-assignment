<h1>Journal</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my example portfolio. I created a template website with Sass, Vanilla JS, and HTML as an assignment for the LUT University.</p>
<p>This is my journal for the project. My conclusion is that making the journal was one of the more complicated parts of the assignment. When you jump straight into a new project it is always hard to keep track of all the learnings per day.</p>
<p>Originally, I used this project at the same time to make a digital advent calendar for my wife. However, since it contains personal information I made a copy containing a more neutral layout. In the project section, you can find one leftover project of the advent calendar. Each day contained a game called Connections.</p>
<p>This was a good exercise.</p>

            <h2>add div with svg images to background with layering</h2>
            <p>to allow layerin of multiple divs the best way is to use the position attribute. relative and absolute. </p>
            <p>relative is good with the background because</p>
            <p>absolute is good for .....because.....</p>

            <h2>playing around with overlapping and changing colors</h2>
            <p>I used the journal to play around with concepts of adaptive styling. I wanted to try to make a cascading look for the journal. make every entry have a different color. Since it is now Ruska, I wanted to start with a spring green color pallet on top and and auturmn color pallet on the bottom. All entries in between will move between the colors. </p>
            <p>to change the colors a picked 2 main colors greenish <i> #91dc5a</i> and redish <i>#dc5a5a</i>. since the blue value is the same "5a" I only needed to adapt the red and blue values. Unfortunatly, SASS does not support any method interative change of colors. therefore I tried to do it in JavaScript.
            <ul>
                <li>At this point I did not succeed in fetching the main 2 colors from the header and the footer. Meaning the colors are not hardcoded and is the color pallet will change in the main.scss file they also need to be changed in the JS code.</li>
            <li>still need to add lighten function to the background color.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>


            <p>to use the for each method on an array fetched by the DOM you need array.foreach() does not work but [...array].foreach() does. because..../p>

    <!--day 5-->
    <div class="journalsection entry" id="Day5">
        <div>
            <h1 class="entryhead">Day 5</h1>
            <h1> Day 5 - 1.1.1. </h1>
            <h2>overall text</h2>
            <div class="timespend">time spend: prox. 4 hours</div>
            <div class="progressmeter">4/5</div>


        
        
        <p>I was struggling with adding a lighter background color to the entry divs. I did a lot of attempts on a function to make it lighter based on a rate, similar to the SASS function but without luck. 
            My attempt of the JS script is in Journal.js together with a function I found on stack overflow that did the trick. I do understand the function but I do not 100% know why my function didn't o the trick. 
I used: https://css-tricks.com/using-javascript-to-adjust-saturation-and-brightness-of-rgb-colors
Found solution in: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5560248/programmatically-lighten-or-darken-a-hex-color-or-rgb-and-blend-colors

also I did a cleanup of the html scss and js code. Make specific files for scss and js for journal section and removed all the test attempts code.
</p>
<p>
At this point we only have the collabsable rows but it doesn't show the date or day + due to the opacity of the background of the entry all other content also has an opacity.
I need to solve these 2 things first.

transpartcy issue: solved by removing the opacity of the div but add an alpha value to the rgb back ground color.
added a function hexToRgba() to the JS that converts the rgb value to a string with the alpha value. note that the old rgb value was a string based on hexes #dc5a5a but the new RGBA can be added by using a string "rgb(255,0,0,0.5)" where the last value is the alpha. Technically I can now rewrite the whole previous functions to not have to include the hexes at all.

====
to show the day and date of the entries I wanted to use another div with layers but after a lot of attempts I did not succeed. An solution I found was to make the H1 element in the div have an position of absolute, which makes is not related to the overflow: hidden. One problem that occures with this plan is that the P text is overlapping with the H1 text. 
an solution I found for styling this is to hide the h1 text when the row is being expand. I first added visibility: hidden in the :hover > h1 which works but when you want to have a transition it doesn't allow this. However, transition do work for text color. so I set text color to invisible in the :hover > H1 and this works perfectly.
