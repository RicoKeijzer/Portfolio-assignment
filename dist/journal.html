      <p>
        Welcome to my example portfolio. I created a template website with Sass,
        Vanilla JS, and HTML as an assignment for the LUT University.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is my journal for the project. My conclusion is that making the
        journal was one of the more complicated parts of the assignment. When
        you jump straight into a new project it is always hard to keep track of
        all the learnings per day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally, I used this project at the same time to make a digital
        advent calendar for my wife. However, since it contains personal
        information I made a copy containing a more neutral layout. In the
        project section, you can find one leftover project of the advent
        calendar. Each day contained a game called Connections.
      </p>
      <p>This was a good exercise.</p>

        <h2>Introduction and watched first licture video from Erno Vanhala</h2>
        <p>Time spend: prox. 8 hours</p>

        <p>
          I already worked a bit with HTML CSS and JS before. I personally did
          not learn much new from the first 3 videos, except for the history
          lessons about the versions of html, css and JS and that the official
          scripting language for webbrowsers is actually called ECMAScript. This
          is actually really interesting.
        </p>

        <p>
          The latter video where really full of new content. Especially the
          parts about media sizings.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the course aims I am a bit surprised that the deliverables are too
          open for interpretation. Hopefully this will be more clear later on.

          Looked into the book Foundation HTML5 with CSS3 by Craig Cook & Jason
          Garber but didn't find to very useful. Most of the content in the book
          is easily findable on internet with better examples.

        <p>
          I now worked already a couple of days on this course but forgot to
          journal correctly
        </p>

        <p>playing around with overlapping and changing colors</p>
        <p>
          I used the journal to play around with concepts of adaptive styling. I
          wanted to try to make a cascading look for the journal. make every
          entry have a different color. Since it is now Ruska, I wanted to start
          with a spring green color pallet on top and and auturmn color pallet
          on the bottom. All entries in between will move between the colors. to
          change the colors a picked 2 main colors greenish #91dc5a and redish
          #dc5a5a. since the blue value is the same "5a" I only needed to adapt
          the red and blue values. Unfortunatly, SASS does not support any
          method interative change of colors. therefore I tried to do it in
          JavaScript. At this point I did not succeed in fetching the main 2
          colors from the header and the footer. Meaning the colors are not
          hardcoded and is the color pallet will change in the main.scss file
          they also need to be changed in the JS code. still need to add lighten
          function to the background color. to use the for each method on an
          array fetched by the DOM you need array.foreach() does not work but
          [...array].foreach() does.
        </p>

        <p>Finishing journal design.</p>

        <p>
          I was struggling with adding a lighter background color to the entry
          divs. I did a lot of attempts on a function to make it lighter based
          on a rate, similar to the SASS function but without luck. My attempt
          of the JS script is in Journal.js together with a function I found on
          stack overflow that did the trick. I do understand the function but I
          do not 100% know why my function didn't o the trick. I used:
          https://css-tricks.com/using-javascript-to-adjust-saturation-and-brightness-of-rgb-colors
          Found solution in:
          https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5560248/programmatically-lighten-or-darken-a-hex-color-or-rgb-and-blend-colors
          also I did a cleanup of the html scss and js code. Make specific files
          for scss and js for journal section and removed all the test attempts
          code.
        </p>

        <p>
          At this point we only have the collabsable rows but it doesn't show
          the date or day + due to the opacity of the background of the entry
          all other content also has an opacity. I need to solve these 2 things
          first. transpartcy issue: solved by removing the opacity of the div
          but add an alpha value to the rgb back ground color. added a function
          hexToRgba() to the JS that converts the rgb value to a string with the
          alpha value. note that the old rgb value was a string based on hexes
          #dc5a5a but the new RGBA can be added by using a string
          "rgb(255,0,0,0.5)" where the last value is the alpha. Technically I
          can now rewrite the whole previous functions to not have to include
          the hexes at all. ==== to show the day and date of the entries I
          wanted to use another div with layers but after a lot of attempts I
          did not succeed. An solution I found was to make the H1 element in the
          div have an position of absolute, which makes is not related to the
          overflow: hidden. One problem that occures with this plan is that the
          P text is overlapping with the H1 text. an solution I found for
          styling this is to hide the h1 text when the row is being expand. I
          first added visibility: hidden in the :hover > h1 which works but when
          you want to have a transition it doesn't allow this. However,
          transition do work for text color. so I set text color to invisible in
          the :hover > H1 and this works perfectly.
        </p>

        <p>
          make the journal entries a fixed height and expand to full size when
          hover over This should hopefully be fully possible by SASS.

        <h1>Days 10 - 12
<h2>Start with set up for main project</h2>
<p>Time spend: prox. 7 hours</p>

<p>I have an idea on how I want it to look and to let the back ground images change like a slider when you scroll down.</p>

<p>Did a lot of initial setup.</p>

        <h1>Day 13</h1>
<h2>Found a way to make fix background imaged while change them based on scrolling behavior</h2> 
<p>Time spend: prox. 3 hours</p>

<p>While struggling for a few days to make my background changing background images based on how far you scroll up and down, I found a solution. I thought it should be possible with just css but then I was watching Mission: Impossible- Dead reckoning part 1 and I knew they had shot the stunt scenes in Norway. While googling it, Norway’s own tourist website had a page for the film and it was doing exactly what I wanted to do. https://www.visitnorway.com/places-to-go/mission-impossible-locations/ .</p>

<p>Using the devtool in chrome I notices the pages were made with react. Although my knowledge of react is not much I noticed when scrolling that multiple classes were updated. This brought me the idea to check it we cannot check the location of the page where we are and check the id of the background.</p>

<p>Researching this, there is a property called scrollTop that returns the height location of the scrolling of the page. This property in combination with the window objects viewheight, can be used to determine where we are on the page and which background image should be should when. 
By making a state variable that sets the page each time you scroll down a full viewport height the state will be changed and the classes will be adapted.</p>

<h2>First commit</h2> 
<p>Time spend: prox. 1 hour</p>

<p>Committed the first setup and tested is github was working well
Decided to use the Github desktop app instead of the terminal. I tried to link the terminal in VS code to my Github account but without succes. Github desktop was already installed and working with Github and VS Code.</p>


<h2>Add header and menu concept</h2>
<p>Time spend: prox. 3 hour</p>

<p>Copied the header and navigation menu from my original project in bit by bit to my new project. During the move I noticed a few cosmetic issues and problems with the JavaScript code.
I also added the responsiveness with screen sizes to the menu. Now when the width of the screen is small the menu is not horizontal on top but vertical on the left top section of the screen.</p>

<h2>Add background sliders to project</h2>
<p>Time spend: prox. 2 hour</p>

<p>Added interactive background images that change along with scrolling every full view height. While moving the code between projects I noticed a lot was broken. It took me a while to get everything into place and working and straight away cleaned up the code.</p>

<h2>Text blocks and structure</h2>
<p>Time spend: prox. 3 hour</p>
<p>Added context text blocks to the sections and created a substructure when we want to show more context blocks in a single section.</p>

<p>Also added the footer and manipulated the JS to show the background images even when we scrolldown on the footer. Previously the final images was removed because js thought that we are scrolling to a further section and updated the image number. Now JS will take into account how many section there are and will not consider the footer as a section.</p>


<p>Adding boxes and using SVG patterns to give a christmas vibe.
